Advent of Code challenges for 2020

I decided to do the Advent of Code challenge for 2020. 
I am doing them in C# since I just got a software engineering position where I will be using C# and I am not familiar with it.
I am mostly just taking my time and learning the features of C#, rather than looking for the 100% most optimal solutions :)
